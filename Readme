# The functions implement two algorithms for generating random graphs with a given degree sequence.
# The algorithm used is from Jingfei Zhang and Yuguo Chen (2013) ÒSampling for Conditional Inference on Network Data,Ó Journal of the American Statistical Association, 108, 1295-1307.# R code is by Jingfei Zhang. It may be used freely, without any warranty, provided that proper credit is given.
#
# GenerateGraphs() implement the sequential importance sampling algorithm for sampling graphs with a fixed degree sequence. It is fast but may provide invalid samples.
#
# GenerateGraphs_Non_Stuck() is a more sophisticated algorithm that guarantees the validity of each sample. However, for the same number of samples, this algorithm usually take longer.
#
# To implement the R code, users must load in the executables from the .c file and the .cpp file (the first three lines in the R code).
